<b><i><u>The Scenario is the following: </b></i></u>

  Sigma Airline is investing in an application that can store and analyze information about their airports. This application is expected to store airport locations, as well as connections between airports. In addition, the application should contain tools to determine shortest paths between two given airlines. Include functionalities to add new airports, and add/remove connections between two airports.


<b><i>Since we are dealing with shortest path in terms of distance, we would need a way to determine the exact location of a city. The application should
include an easy to use interface that abstracts the complexities of the program. Users can simply input a city name, such as "New York", and your
program should determine the latitudeÂ­longitude mark (e.g. 40.7127837 74.0059413). </b> </i>
