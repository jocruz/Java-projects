Random assorts of Java programs I worked on/ am currently working on. These are some of my recent projects to further understand data structures.

For Stacks I attempted a solitair game. (Stackotaire)

For Queues I attempted a Stony Brook Bus Similator.

For a solo project I taclked out a Location driver application where a user can input a locations and will determine Long and Lang.
