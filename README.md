# ☕ Java Projects Portfolio

## 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to my collection of Java projects, a diverse array of programs that reflect my ongoing journey and growth in Java development. These projects are not just a testament to my learning but also a deliberate effort to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, aiming to craft real-world applications and delve into the realm of Android development.

## 🛠️ Project Highlights

- **Array Lists:** 🃏 For Array Lists, I developed a `Baseball Card Manager`, managing collections with finesse.
- **Linked Lists:** 📅 Crafted a `Scheduler Manager` and `Custom Itinerary`, organizing tasks with precision.
- **Stacks:** 🎴 Took on the challenge of creating a solitaire game, dubbed `Stackotaire`, stacking elements in a fun twist.
- **Queues:** 🚌 Engineered a `Stony Brook Bus Simulator`, orchestrating queue dynamics in a simulated transport network.
- **Solo Project:** 🌍 Embarked on creating a `Location Driver Application`, where users input destinations and receive latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **Trees:** 🌳 Developed a `Tree Navigator` to manipulate and navigate through decision trees, enhancing understanding of tree data structures. Also crafted a `Tree Kiosk Simulator` to mimic real-world applications, demonstrating advanced concepts in tree manipulation and traversal, which further showcases my proficiency in Java, object-oriented programming, and complex data structures and algorithms.
- **Graphs and Adjacency Matrix:** 📊 Developed a **Sigma Airline Simulator** ✈️. Masterfully developed a `Sigma Airline` management application, showcasing advanced Java programming, graph theory, and dynamic data structure utilization. This simulator features an intuitive interface for managing airport networks, using an **Adjacency Matrix** for efficient route and distance tracking, and **ArrayLists** for dynamic airport data handling. The project employs **custom Comparators** to sort airports by various criteria, enhancing user interaction and data retrieval efficiency. The implementation of the **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** demonstrates a sophisticated approach to pathfinding, enabling the calculation of shortest paths between airports. This simulator encapsulates the essence of real-world applications with persistent data management through Java **Serialization**, highlighting my ability to architect complex, efficient, and user-centric software solutions.

## 📂 Detailed Project Descriptions
