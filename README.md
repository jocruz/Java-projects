# Java-projects
Random assorts of Java programs I worked on/ am currently working on. These are some of my recent projects to further understand data structures.
 
For Array Lists I did a baseball card manager

For LinkedList I did a Scheduler manager and Custom Itinerary. 

For Stacks I attempted a solitair game. (Stackotaire)
